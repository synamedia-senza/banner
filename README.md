# Banner ES5

Play video with an advertising banner, and switch between the local and remote players.

## Changes

This version is compatible with ES54 and does not use ES6 features:

* no classes
* loads scripts from CDN instead of importing modules
* var instead of let
* function() instead of () => {}
* .then() instead of async/await
* no webpack
