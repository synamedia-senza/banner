# Banner

This app demonstrates how to play video using the Senza version of the Shaka player, which handles integration with the remote player. After a few seconds of inactivity, it automatically switches from foreground to background mode.

This version of the Banner app imports the Senza SDK using a script tag. See the [https://github.com/synamedia-senza/banner-pro](banner-pro) repo for a version of the app that loads the Senza SDK from an NPM package and supports additional features like protected content and subtitles.

See the [Playing Video](https://developer.synamedia.com/senza/docs/playing-video) tutorial in the Senza developer documentation.

## Interface

* OK - toggle between foreground and background mode
* Back - pause and play the video
* Left/Right - skip backwards and forwards by 30 seconds
